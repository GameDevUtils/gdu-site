<img src="/images/passion.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; width:50%;" />GameDevUtils.com is a suite of tools that I designed for my game programming students. There are certainly better products out there, but I wanted my students to have access to free tools and, more importantly, access to the source code for those tools. I also didn’t want the tools to look like poop that was developed in the 80’s.

I divided and _planned_ to conqor. I started with the best of intentions, delivering the first module (Sheets&mdash;a sprite packer) on November 10, 2016. Then I released a teaser / preview for the next module (Fonts&mdash;a TTF/OTF to PNG/GIF converter) a little more than a week later.

By this point, my brain was working overtime to thwart my plans. I felt like the offering wasn't good enough. I assumed that no one was using it. It wasn't a complete waste of time, though. I learned a lot along the way. But wrapping up the remaining modules without any kind of feedback didn't appeal to me at all.
